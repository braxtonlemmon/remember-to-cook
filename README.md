# Remember To Cook
This is a social networking site for people who cook. A user can create and share recipes with other users of the site.

# Why?
In studying with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home) I learned the Ruby on Rails framework. I started this project to practice and solidify the concepts I've learned.
